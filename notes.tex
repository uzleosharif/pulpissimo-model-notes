\title{Modeling Peripherals of Pulpissimo Chip}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Goal}
The goal of this work is to model the peripherals, especially the $\mu$DMA based, of the Pulpissimo Chip.
The models are developed in SystemC at a fairly high abstraction level. Key thing is to ensure that this
chip model could be used for quick SW development by other teams. Currently, we see following work items:

\begin{todolist}
 % \item[\done], \item[wontfix] ...
 \item Setup TGC-VP simulation on Ubuntu20 (EDA machine)
 \item Insert bare-bone peripheral on the address of $\mu$DMA and make sure this can be accessed on a dummy register
 via SW
 \item SPI-M model using Minres API
 \item I2S model using Minres API
 \item create Pulpissimo project in \texttt{VPVibes} space and push modified TGC-VP in this space
 \item pull request for the peripherals in \texttt{VPVPerph}
\end{todolist}
